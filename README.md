## AAA Master Class :: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This repository features a series of interactive Jupyter Notebooks for the Fall term 2021 lab course accompanying the 
7,044,1.00 *Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning* course offered at the 
University of St. Gallen (HSG).

The ineractive lab will walk you through the detection of accounting anomalies using deep autoencoder neural networks. The the lab content is based on [Python](https://www.python.org), [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org).

## How To Run the Lab Notebooks

You can run Jupyter Notebooks either in the cloud via Binder (https://mybinder.org/) or Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally via a Python installation of your computer.

#### [Option 1] Binder Cloud Environment ([![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GitiHubi/courseAAA/main))

This is the easiest way to run a Notebook in your web browser: just click on the binder badge next to 
the Notebooks below and off you go. Binder is a service that lets you run Jupyter Notebooks in their cloud at no charge. 
There is no registration and no
login required. However, keep in mind that you cannot save any data or your Notebook file in the cloud (you can save them
on your computer, though). Also, starting a binder
Notebook can take quite some time, but the performance during runtime is good. 
For more information, please refer to the [Binder documentation](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

#### [Option 2] Google Colab Environment ([![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/GitiHubi/courseAAA/blob/main))

Similar to binder, you just have to click the Colab badge next to the Notebooks below. All you need is a Google login
(e.g., your login information for gmail) and you can use this service at no charge. 
Two advantages of Colab are that (1) you can save your 
Notebooks directly into your Google Drive and read data from there, and (2) Google provides you with some limited GPU capabilities
free of charge (this will be an interesting feature for the coding challenge.)

#### [Option 3] Local Python Installation ([![Install Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-v3.7-green)](https://python.org), [![Install Anaconda](https://img.shields.io/badge/conda-v3.7.1-green)](https://anaconda.com))

If you prefer to run Notebooks locally on your computer, you will need to install Python. If you choose to do so,
we recommend to install [Anaconda Python](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a package that combines the 
latest version of Python with the most common supplemental modules for data science and machine learning, as well 
as a Jupyter Notebook server that runs on your computer locally. Anaconda 
[installers](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) are available 
for the most common operating systems, as well as some 
[detailed installation guides](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 

To run our Notebooks locally, you can download them individually from this website, 
or simply clone this repository to your computer. 

If you need help running Python and/or Jupyter Notebooks, please don't hesitate to contact us (see below)!
